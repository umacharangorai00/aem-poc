Sling api for event handling
----------------------------
1. Can be configured to listen to only specific paths.
Multiple watch paths can also be configured to provide it a more granular approach.

2. For a bulk operation concerning N resources, listener will be executed ONLY once.
Thus, total number of persistence operations = 1 (via handler) + 1 (Bulk operation) = 2

3.  This is only recommended for resource change events.

4. Avoid long-lived sessions.

5. This is register using Framework Service Registry
